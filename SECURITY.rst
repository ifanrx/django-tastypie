Security Policy
===============

Tastypie is committed to providing a flexible and secure API, and was designed
with many security features and options in mind. Due to the complex nature of
APIs and the constant discovery of new attack vectors and vulnerabilities,
no software is immune to security holes. We rely on our community to report
and help us investigate security issues.

If you come across a security hole **please do not open a Github issue**.
Instead, **drop us an email** at ``tastypie-security@googlegroups.com``

We'll then work together to investigate and resolve the problem so we can
announce a solution along with the vulnerability.
